📝 Meeting & Email Minutes

Paste text or upload files (.txt / .pdf / .docx) → get clean, structured minutes: Decisions, Action Items (Owner/Deadline), Risks, Open Questions, Next Steps.

  - Audience switch: Executive / Operations / Technical
  
  - Polish toggle: keeps bullets & spacing tidy
  
  - PII masking (optional): emails/phones/names masked before any AI call

  - Local-only mode: works without an API key (template output), so no data leaves the session

🎯 Problem

Teams lose time turning messy meeting notes or email threads into shareable minutes. It’s tedious, inconsistent, and often delayed.

✅ Solution

A single-page app: paste or upload → click Generate Minutes → get structured, business-friendly output in seconds. Optional AI enhances structure; without AI, you still get a clean template.

🚀 How It Works

1. Input: Paste text or upload .txt, .pdf, .docx.

2. (Optional) PII Masking: Replace emails, phones, and names with neutral tags before AI.

3. Generate:

      - With AI (OpenAI): Produces concise minutes tailored to the selected audience.
  
      - Without AI: Returns a ready-to-edit Minutes template (no external calls).

4. Polish: Toggle formatting to ensure neat bullets and spacing.
